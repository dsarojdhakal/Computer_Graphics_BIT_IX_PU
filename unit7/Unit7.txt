Unit 7: Graphical Languages

7.1 Need for Machine-Independent Graphical Language (GKS and PHIGS)
7.2 Discussion of Available Graphical Languages and File Formats

1. Hardware Dependence
        In the early development of computer graphics,graphics programs were closely tied to specific
        hardware devices such as monitors, plotters, and input peripherals.
        Each graphics device had its own command set, coordinate system, and control method.
        As a result, a program written for one graphics system could not be used on another system
        without major modifications.
        This hardware dependence created serious problems in portability, maintenance, and
        software development efficiency.
        

2. Need for Machine-Independent Graphical Languages
        Machine-independent graphical languages were introduced to remove the dependency between
        graphics software and hardware.
        The main needs of Machine-Independent Graphical Languages are :
            Portability:
                Graphics programs should run on different machines without rewriting the code.
            Hardware Abstraction:
                Programmers work with logical graphics functions instead of device-specific commands.
            Reduced Development Cost:
                Eliminates multiple versions of the same program for different hardware.
            Device Uniformity:
                Same program can produce output on displays, printers, and plotters.
            Easy Maintenance:
                Hardware upgrades do not affect application programs.
            Standardization:
                Ensures consistent graphics behavior across different systems and vendors.


3. Graphical Kernel System (GKS)
        The Graphical Kernel System (GKS) is a standard, machine-independent graphics programming 
        interface mainly designed for 2D graphics.
        GKS supports basic 2D output primitives such as Polyline, Polymarker, Text, Fill Area, and Cell Array.
        GKS uses logical input devices independent of physical hardware such as Locator, Stroke, Valuator, Choice, Pick, and String.
        GKS provides coordinate transformation from World Coordinates to Normalized Device Coordinates 
        and then to Device Coordinates.
        GKS supports multiple workstations for output to different devices.
        GKS uses segment storage to group graphical elements for manipulation.
        GKS allows graphical attributes such as line type, color, text font, and fill style to be set for primitives.
        GKS provides bundled attributes for consistent appearance across multiple primitives.
        GKS supports multiple levels of implementation for workstations including basic output, 
        input handling, and segment manipulation.
        GKS input devices operate in REQUEST, SAMPLE, or EVENT modes to handle different interaction types.
        GKS allows creation, modification, and deletion of segments for better graphics management.
        GKS provides a standard environment for 2D plotting, scientific visualization, business graphics, and educational purposes.
        GKS ensures device independence so that the same program works on different output devices without modification.
        GKS supports workstation-independent segment storage to allow sharing of graphical objects between devices.
        GKS is mainly used for simple graphics applications, business charts, and scientific visualization.
        
        Limitations of GKS:
            GKS supports only 2D graphics and cannot handle 3D modeling.
            GKS provides limited interaction capabilities for dynamic or complex applications.
            GKS segment storage is not suitable for highly detailed or hierarchical graphics.
            GKS lacks advanced rendering features such as lighting, shading, textures, 
            and hidden surface removal.



4. Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS)
        PHIGS is an advanced, machine-independent graphics standard for 2D and 3D graphics.
        PHIGS uses a hierarchical structure model where objects can reference other structures.
        Transformations and attributes are inherited through the hierarchy for efficient scene management.
        PHIGS supports primitives like Polylines, Polymarkers, Text, Fill Areas, Surfaces, and 3D polygons.
        PHIGS provides a viewing pipeline from world coordinates to normalized device coordinates to device coordinates.
        Segments can be created, modified, or deleted, allowing incremental updates without full redraw.
        Input devices like Locator, Stroke, Valuator, Choice, Pick, and String with advanced interaction modes.
        Hierarchical editing allows opening, inserting, replacing, and posting structures for display.
        PHIGS+ extensions add lighting, shading and hidden surface removal.
        PHIGS is used in CAD/CAM, architectural design, flight simulators, and interactive applications.
        Device independence allows programs to run on different devices without modification.
        Object reuse through instancing reduces memory use and improves efficiency.
        PHIGS is suitable for complex hierarchical scenes and interactive professional graphics.

        Limitations of PHIGS:
            PHIGS is complex and has a steep learning curve.
            PHIGS requires high memory and processing for large scenes.
            Hierarchical editing can be time-consuming.
            PHIGS has limited support in modern systems compared to OpenGL and Direct3D.
