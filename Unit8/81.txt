Unit 8: Introduction to Animation

    Animation(Illusion of Motion)
            Animation is the art of creating the illusion of movement.
            It works by showing many slightly different still images called frames very fast.
            The human eye and brain blend these frames together. This is called persistence of vision.
            It makes lifeless drawings or objects appear alive.
            Used in movies, games, ads, education, and anywhere humans prefer visuals over effort.

            Frames: Individual still/static images with small changes.

            Persistence of Vision: The brain keeps an image for a short time,so frames appear continuous.

            Timing & Spacing:
                    Close frames  -> fast motion
                    Far frames    -> slow motion
                    Bad timing    -> jumpy, ugly animation


            Simple Example (Flipbook):
                    - Draw small changes on each page
                    - Flip pages fast
                    - Motion appears automatically


            Types of Animation
                Traditional (Cel Animation):
                - Hand-drawn images on transparent sheets (cels)
                - Each frame is drawn separately by artists
                - Very time-consuming and labor-intensive
                - Used in early Disney and classic cartoons

                2D Digital Animation:
                - Created using computers and animation software
                - Uses vector or bitmap graphics
                - Faster and easier to edit than hand-drawn animation
                - Common in cartoons, mobile games, and web content

                3D Animation (CGI):
                - Characters and objects are modeled in 3D space
                - Allows realistic lighting, shadows, and textures
                - Requires powerful hardware and rendering
                - Widely used in movies, games, and simulations

                Stop Motion:
                - Physical objects or puppets are moved slightly
                - Each movement is captured as a photograph
                - Produces a realistic, handmade look
                - Requires patience and precise control

                Motion Graphics:
                - Focuses on text, shapes, and abstract visuals
                - Often synchronized with music or voice
                - Used in advertisements, titles, and presentations
                - Does not usually involve characters



    Introduction to OpenGL
            OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a powerful,cross-platform graphics programming interface.
            It is used to create 2D and 3D graphics by communicating directly with the computer’s
            graphics hardware (GPU).
            OpenGL acts as a bridge between the program and the graphics system, allowing developers
            to draw shapes, images, and realistic scenes.
            It does not manage windows, keyboard, or mouse.
            Instead, it focuses only on rendering graphics, while other libraries handle user interaction. 
            It provides fast graphics rendering using GPU
            It works on multiple operating systems
            It gives low-level control over graphics drawing
            It is suitable for real-time graphics applications
            OpenGL is widely used for real-time graphics,visualization, and simulation across industries.

            Features of OpenGL
                - Platform independent and portable
                - Hardware accelerated for high performance
                - Supports both simple 2D and complex 3D graphics
                - Open standard maintained by Khronos Group

            How OpenGL Works
                OpenGL follows a pipeline-based approach.
                First, the programmer sends data such as points, lines, colors, and textures to OpenGL.
                This data is processed step by step inside the graphics pipeline using the GPU.
                Finally, the processed data is converted into pixels and displayed on the screen.

            Graphics Pipeline 
                Vertex Processing:It handles position and transformation of points
                Primitive Assembly:It combines vertices to form lines and triangles
                Rasterization:Converts geometric shapes into pixel data
                Fragment Processing: Adds color, lighting, shading, and textures




    Applications of OpenGL

    Today’s Trends in OpenGL

            Legacy Status & Transition
                OpenGL 4.6 (2017) is likely the final major version of OpenGL.
                Khronos Group now focuses on Vulkan as the modern low-level graphics API.
                Many developers are migrating to Vulkan and DirectX 12.
                OpenGL ES 3.2 remains active for mobile and embedded systems.


            Modernization Efforts 
                OpenGL is still preferred for:
                - Education due to easier learning curve
                - Maintaining legacy applications
                - Quick prototyping
                - Applications not requiring extreme performance
                - Zink: OpenGL implemented on top of Vulkan
                - ANGLE: OpenGL ES implemented over DirectX and Vulkan

            Platform Support Trends 
                OpenGL supported by NVIDIA and AMD, but focus is shifting to DX12 and Vulkan(Windows).
                OpenGL remains important (Apple deprecated it in 2018)(Linux / macOS).
                OpenGL ES still dominant, but Vulkan (Android) and Metal (iOS) are growing(Mobile).
                WebGL (based on OpenGL ES) is widely used for browser-based graphics(web).

            Industry Shifts 
                Unity still supports OpenGL but recommends Vulkan and DirectX 12(Game Engines).
                Unreal Engine is moving away from OpenGL.
                Many CAD/CAM tools still rely on OpenGL for stability and compatibility.
                Most computer graphics courses continue to teach OpenGL fundamentals.
